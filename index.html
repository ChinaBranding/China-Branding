        <p>Wow, it’s hot!</p>
<p>‘How can you discuss tea at such a time?’ you may ask.</p>
<p>‘I want my magazine to transport me somewhere far away… ‘At least we could talk<br>about some refreshing drinks.’</p>
<p>For many westerners, refreshing might mean a cold drink - possibly something<br>with a fruity bite. And for some Americans, that might actually include iced<br>tea.</p>
<p>Ambient heat saps energy. So it makes a kind of sense to compensate for that<br>energy slump using sugar (dissolved energy) and citrus extracts (often<br>considered reviving). Caffeine, theoretically, should also make us feel less<br>like wilting.</p>
<p>But what if we could do more than ‘compensate for’ the ravages of heat? What if<br>we could ‘expel’ heat? That’s the aim of many Chinese medicine tips offered in<br>summer.</p>
<p>There’s a tradition of drinking green tea in these months. Part of it stems from<br>the need to consume a perishable product at its most fresh. And green tea is<br>also considered to be an inherently ‘heat-reducing’ (下火的) ingredient - a<br>characteristic also ascribed to certain bitter (mostly green) vegetables. It’s<br>because of this that you’ll often hear people in China say that in hot weather<br>you need to brew your green tea even hotter. Certainly, the bitter (astringent)<br>aspects of a green tea come to the fore when you really scald those leaves.</p>
<p>The immediate effect of drinking something hot while being hot is strange; it’s<br>only later – once sweat is accelerated – that one feels anything like relief.<br>It’s also at these higher brewing temperatures that more caffeine is released.<br>That – I suggest - is part of the relieving effect.</p>
<p>But there are also some other compounds at work – particularly theanine – which<br>is associated not with stimulation but with alleviation of stress sensations.<br>(Probably quite useful these days). Highly volatile, theanine is known to be<br>absorbed by the body less efficiently when drunk cold than hot. So I am probably<br>missing out on a lot of theanine, for my preference these days is to drink green<br>tea from unheated water, topping it up and glugging until I have regained<br>everything sweated out at night (that’s whole pints before peeing). Nevermind<br>the reticence about hot liquid in hot weather; in the morning I’m just too<br>impatient to wait for it to heat.</p>
<p>Additionally, we’ve recently been experimenting with frozen tea lollies /<br>popsicles.</p>
<p>So how well does it work? Well, the lack of sweetener is probably more of a<br>polarizing issue frozen than it is with the cold bottled drinks (东方树叶) we<br>discussed earlier this year. The other (related) issue is the distribution of<br>flavour; the freezing process reminds us that tea is a suspension of solid<br>compounds in water, rather than a blanket modification of H2O. The tea flavor<br>gathers mostly in the tip of the ice pop – as well as in some craggy seams. So<br>far, darker leaves – like the recently-mentioned 大红袍 Dà Hóng Páo - seem to<br>make for better ice lollies than do green teas.</p>
<p>I hope that cooled you down a little. If not, try waving your magazine as a fan.</p>
